#### Tools Used During the Journey:

+ **nmap**: (Network Mapper)  
  Nmap is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

+ **ftp**: (File Transfer Protocol)  
  FTP is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

+ **Wireshark**: (Network Protocol Analyzer)  
  Wireshark is a widely-used network protocol analyzer that captures and analyzes network packets in real time. It helps in troubleshooting network issues, inspecting data traffic, and diagnosing security problems.

+ **Metasploit**: (Penetration Testing Framework)  
  Metasploit is a powerful penetration testing framework that helps security professionals identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system. It includes a variety of exploits, payloads, and auxiliary tools for testing security.

+ **curl**: (Data Transfer Tool)  
  Curl is a command-line tool used for transferring data using various network protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and others. It's commonly used to test APIs, fetch web pages, or interact with online resources from the terminal.

+ **ssh**: (Secure Shell)  
  SSH is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access remote systems over an insecure network. It enables secure communication, file transfers, and remote command execution.

+ **Burp Suite**: (Web Vulnerability Scanner)  
  Burp Suite is a popular security testing tool for web applications. It provides a range of tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web apps, including an intercepting proxy, a web crawler, and a vulnerability scanner.
